# 2bRAD-workshop
These instructions were developed as an introduction for undergraduates researching corals from St. Croix (STX), USVI. These materials were made for participants to reference when learning to process next-generation sequences (2bRAD specifically), then implement population genetics and genotype-environment association analyses.

Notes in TACC_Workshop.pdf are beginner lessons in using TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center) and shell scripting. Scripts in STX.sh contain the 2bRAD pipeline for processing sequences in the STX coral project. If implementing these scripts in other projects, please change the project IDs, genomes, and emails referenced throughout.
